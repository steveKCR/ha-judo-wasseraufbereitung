## Network Requirements

- The JUDO device must be on the **same local network** as your Home Assistant instance.
- Communication uses **HTTP** (port 80) with **Basic Authentication**.
- No internet connection is required — all communication is local.

## Integration Branding (HA 2026.3+)

This integration now ships local branding assets in:

`custom_components/jucontrol_local/brand/`

Included files:

- `icon.png`
- `icon@2x.png`
- `logo.png`
- `logo@2x.png`

Home Assistant resolves integration images by domain (`jucontrol_local`) and loads these assets automatically.
Per-device logos are not supported via `device_info`; visible images come from integration branding.

Quick check endpoints in your HA instance:

- `/api/brands/integration/jucontrol_local/icon.png`
- `/api/brands/integration/jucontrol_local/logo.png`

If a file is missing or the domain/path is wrong, Home Assistant returns a default placeholder image.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| **Cannot connect** | Verify the IP address is correct and the device is powered on. Ensure Home Assistant can reach the device (same VLAN/subnet). |
| **Invalid authentication** | Check username and password. Default credentials are `admin` / `Connectivity`. |
| **Unknown device** | The device type is not yet supported. Please open an issue on GitHub with your device model. |
| **Entities not updating** | Check the polling interval in the integration options. Verify network connectivity to the device. |
| **Entities show "unavailable"** | The device may be temporarily unreachable. Check your network and device status. |
